## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```shell
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```shell
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Pre-commit Hooks

When running `npm install` the `prepare` script runs to install husky pre-commit hooks into `./husky/pre-commit`. Currently the hook automatically formats the code using prettier, then checks the code for linting issues. If there is a linting issue, it doesn't try to fix it. Instead, the commit fails with an error message.

If you want to make sure the pre-commit hooks are working, do the following

1. Stage some badly linted/formatted code
2. run `npx lint-staged`
   If there were only formatting issues, the hook will format your code and silently add it to the commit. If there were linting issues, the commit should fail.

## Testing and Coverage

Tests are located in `/test` and are using Vitetest. Please write at least one test per component. This way, we can do broad refactorings and find out very quickly what is broken.

```shell
npm run test
npm run coverage
```
